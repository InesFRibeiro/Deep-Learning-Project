### Description 
The purpose of the current work was to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
to perform multi-class image classification to differentiate between five different types of
flowers. To build, validate and assess CNN models, publicly available data was used from
the Kaggle dataset “ Flower Recognition CNN Keras”. This dataset consists of 4326
images, featuring the following flower species: daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower and tulip.
Upon feeding an image as input to the CNN models, the expected output was the label of
the class that the model predicts. The dataset was slightly imbalanced, a property which was
taken into account for throughout the development of the models.
